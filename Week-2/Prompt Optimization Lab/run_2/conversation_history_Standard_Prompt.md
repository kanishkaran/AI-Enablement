I was charged $47 but my plan is $39. What's going on?
```
### ASSISTANT

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I understand how frustrating it can be to see a higher charge than expected, and I’d like to help you get to the bottom of this.

To investigate further, could you let me know if you made any changes to your account recently, such as adding users, features, or upgrading your plan? Also, did your billing cycle renew, or was this your first payment after a trial period?

Based on what I can see, sometimes the difference comes from things like add-on services or taxes, which may not be included in the base plan price. You can check a full breakdown by visiting your account dashboard under the "Billing" section—this will list any additional items included in this invoice.

Here’s what we can do:
1. Review your latest invoice in your account to see detailed charges.
2. Let me know if you notice any unfamiliar items or if you need help understanding a specific line item.

Once you’ve checked, I’m happy to explain any charges you’re unsure about. Does this help clarify, and is there anything specific on the invoice you’d like more details on?

this was my first payment

Thank you for letting me know this was your first payment. That’s helpful, and I understand seeing a higher amount can be confusing when you’re just getting started.

For first payments, a few things might explain the difference:
1. **Taxes**: Depending on your location, applicable sales or VAT taxes may be added to your subscription fee.
2. **Pro-rated Charges**: If your plan started partway through a billing period, sometimes a partial period or a setup fee gets included.
3. **Add-ons or Extras**: Occasionally, optional features or services are added during signup.

Could you confirm your location (country or state), so I can clarify if taxes applied? Also, did you select any add-ons or premium features when signing up?

You can view an itemized invoice in your account dashboard under "Billing", which should show a breakdown of the $47 charge.

Once you check, let me know if any item on the invoice looks unfamiliar, and I’ll gladly explain it in detail. Does this help clarify, or would you like help finding your invoice summary?

US

Thanks for confirming you're in the US. That helps narrow down possible reasons for the extra charge.

In the US, sales tax is sometimes added to subscription payments, depending on your state and local regulations. This could explain why your $39 plan was billed as $47. On your invoice in the "Billing" section of your account dashboard, you should see a line item for sales tax if it was applied.

To confirm, could you check your invoice for any mention of "sales tax" or additional fees? If you don’t see anything about taxes or add-ons, please let me know—I'll help investigate further.

Once you review your invoice, I’m happy to walk through any specific charges that aren’t clear. Does this explanation help, or would you like step-by-step guidance on locating your invoice?
