Hello! Thanks for reaching out. How can I help you today with your billing or account? If you’re experiencing any issues or have questions about a recent charge, please let me know the details so I can assist you.

I want a refund. I signed up 3 weeks ago but haven't really used it
```
### ASSISTANT

Thank you for letting me know, and I’m sorry to hear the service hasn’t met your expectations so far. I understand you'd like a refund since you haven’t really used it after signing up three weeks ago.

Our billing team handles all refund requests to ensure they’re reviewed according to our company policy. I’ll need to escalate your request to them for further action. Before I do, could you please confirm whether you signed up for a monthly or annual plan? Also, was there anything specific that made it difficult for you to use the service—just so I can make a note for the team?

Once I have this information, I’ll forward your request right away. Our billing team typically responds within 2-3 business days. Please let me know if you have questions about what happens next or need help with anything else in the meantime.

monthly plan and nothing in specific

Thank you for confirming you’re on the monthly plan, and I appreciate your quick response.

I’ll escalate your refund request to our billing team immediately. They’ll review your account and follow up according to our refund policy—this usually takes about 2-3 business days. 

You won’t need to take any further steps right now; the team will contact you at the email address on your account with updates or next steps. If you have other questions or concerns in the meantime, please let me know—I’m here to help.

Just to confirm, are you okay with waiting for a response from our billing team, or do you have any other urgent billing needs?

I am not okay with waiting
```
### ASSISTANT
```
I completely understand that waiting for a refund response can be frustrating, especially when you haven’t been able to use the service as you intended. I want to make sure your concern is addressed as quickly as possible.

While I don’t have the ability to process refunds directly, I will mark your request as urgent and notify the billing team about your preference for a faster resolution. This action helps prioritize your case in their queue.

If you’d like, I can also help you with any other account-related questions or guide you on how to pause or cancel your subscription while your refund request is being reviewed. Please let me know your preference, and rest assured I’ll do everything I can to support you during this process.

Is there anything else you’d like me to pass along to the billing team about your situation?
