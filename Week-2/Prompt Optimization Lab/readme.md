## Run Structure

### Run 1
- **Location:** `run_1/`
- **Best Performing System Prompt:** Structured Role-Based Prompt
- **Why:** Although both prompts gave a good result, for the task for refund or any simple questions the step by step answering would not be prefered, also since the CoT approach produces reasonings that should also be read which takes longer time.

### Run 2
- **Location:** `run_2/`
- **Best Performing System Prompt:** Chain of thought Prompt
- **Why:** When dealing with the specifics like total amount involved or the charges, CoT prompt would be best. Since this should involve detailed explaination of task in hand, what should be done and the conclusion etc..
