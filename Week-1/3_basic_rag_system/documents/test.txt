The northern gannet (Morus bassanus) is a seabird, the largest species of the gannet family, Sulidae. 
It is native to the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, breeding in Western Europe and northeastern North America. 
It is the largest seabird in the northern Atlantic. The sexes are similar in appearance. Nesting takes place in colonies on both sides of the North Atlantic. 
Its breeding range has extended northward and eastward, with colonies being established on Russia's Kola Peninsula in 1995 and Bear Island (the southernmost island of Svalbard) in 2011.
Colonies are mostly located on offshore islands with cliffs, from which birds can more easily launch into the air. 
The northern gannet undertakes seasonal migrations and catches fish (which are the mainstay of its diet) by making high-speed dives into the sea. 
It faces few other natural or man-made threats. 
Because the northern gannet is both a conspicuous and a common bird, it is referred to in several ancient myths and legends
