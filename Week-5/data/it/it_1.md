---

## Project Overview

This proposal outlines a comprehensive infrastructure upgrade to modernize our technology stack, improve system reliability, and enhance cybersecurity posture. The project is critical to support our anticipated 40% growth in user base over the next 18 months.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Infrastructure Challenges

**Server Infrastructure:** Legacy on-premise servers (avg. 7 years old) experiencing increased failure rates and maintenance costs exceeding $45,000 annually.

**Network Capacity:** Current bandwidth at 87% utilization during peak hours, causing latency issues for remote workers and cloud applications.

**Security Vulnerabilities:** 23 systems running end-of-life software with no available security patches, creating compliance and risk exposure.

**Backup & Recovery:** Current RTO (Recovery Time Objective) of 24 hours exceeds business requirements for critical systems.

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Cloud Migration (Months 1-4)

Migrate 70% of workloads to AWS infrastructure using a hybrid cloud model.

**Key Components:**
- EC2 instances with auto-scaling capabilities
- RDS managed databases for improved reliability
- S3 storage with lifecycle policies
- CloudWatch monitoring and alerting

**Benefits:** 99.99% uptime SLA, reduced hardware maintenance, elastic scaling

### Phase 2: Network Upgrade (Months 3-5)

Upgrade network infrastructure to support 10Gbps connectivity.

**Implementation:**
- Replace core switches and routers
- Implement SD-WAN for branch offices
- Deploy new firewall clusters with IPS/IDS
- Upgrade WiFi to WiFi 6E standard

**Benefits:** 5x bandwidth increase, improved security, better remote work support

### Phase 3: Security Enhancement (Months 4-6)

Deploy comprehensive security improvements across all systems.

**Security Measures:**
- Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) implementation
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platform
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system
- Quarterly penetration testing program

**Benefits:** Reduced attack surface, compliance with SOC 2 requirements, real-time threat detection

## Budget Estimate

| Category | Cost | Timeline |
|----------|------|----------|
| Cloud Infrastructure (Annual) | $180,000 | Ongoing |
| Network Equipment | $245,000 | One-time |
| Security Software & Services | $125,000 | Annual |
| Professional Services | $95,000 | One-time |
| Staff Training | $22,000 | One-time |
| Contingency (15%) | $100,000 | One-time |
| **Total Year 1** | **$767,000** | |
| **Annual Recurring (Year 2+)** | **$305,000** | |

## ROI Analysis

**Cost Savings:**
- Reduced hardware maintenance: $45,000/year
- Decreased downtime (estimated): $120,000/year
- Energy cost reduction: $18,000/year
- **Total Annual Savings:** $183,000

**Payback Period:** 4.2 years

**Intangible Benefits:** Improved employee productivity, enhanced security posture, better customer experience, increased business agility

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk Items:**
- Data migration complexity during cloud transition
- Potential service disruption during network cutover
- Staff learning curve on new systems

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Phased migration with rollback capabilities
- Scheduled maintenance windows for critical upgrades
- Comprehensive training program beginning 60 days before deployment

## Resource Requirements

**Internal Team:**
- 2 Systems Administrators (full-time for 6 months)
- 1 Network Engineer (full-time for 4 months)
- 1 Security Analyst (part-time for 6 months)

**External Partners:**
- AWS Solutions Architect (consulting)
- Network implementation vendor
- Security audit firm

## Project Timeline

**Month 1-2:** Planning, procurement, and initial setup  
**Month 3-4:** Cloud migration Phase 1  
**Month 4-5:** Network infrastructure deployment  
**Month 5-6:** Security implementation and testing  
**Month 6:** Final validation and documentation  

## Success Metrics

- System uptime: Achieve 99.9% availability
- Incident response time: Reduce by 60%
- Security incidents: Reduce by 75%
- User satisfaction: Achieve 85%+ satisfaction rating
- Compliance: Pass SOC 2 Type II audit

## Recommendation

The IT team strongly recommends proceeding with this upgrade proposal. The current infrastructure poses significant business risks and the proposed solution aligns with our strategic objectives for growth and security.
