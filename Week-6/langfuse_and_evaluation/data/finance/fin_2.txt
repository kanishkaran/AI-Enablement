## Purpose

This policy establishes standardized procedures for invoice processing, approval workflows, and payment execution to ensure accurate financial records, timely vendor payments, and proper internal controls.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees who submit, approve, or process invoices and payment requests across all departments and subsidiaries.

## Policy Statement

All invoices must be processed through the approved accounts payable workflow with proper documentation, authorization, and verification before payment is issued.

## Invoice Submission Requirements

### Required Documentation

All invoices submitted for payment must include:

- Original vendor invoice with unique invoice number
- Valid purchase order number (for PO-based purchases)
- Proof of receipt or service completion
- Department manager approval signature or email
- Proper GL account coding

### Invoice Format Standards

Acceptable invoice formats include PDF, scanned images, or paper originals. Invoices must clearly display:

- Vendor name and address
- Invoice date and due date
- Itemized description of goods or services
- Quantities and unit prices
- Subtotal, tax amounts, and total due
- Payment terms and remittance address

## Approval Workflow

### Authorization Limits

| Director | $25,000 | $100,000 |
| VP/C-Suite | $100,000 | No limit |
| CEO | No limit | No limit |

Invoices exceeding authorization limits require escalation to the next approval level.

### Approval Process Timeline

**Day 1-2:** Invoice received and logged into system  
**Day 3-5:** Routed to department for verification  
**Day 6-7:** Manager approval and GL coding  
**Day 8-10:** Finance review and validation  
**Day 11:** Payment scheduling  

Standard processing time is 11 business days from invoice receipt to payment execution.

## Payment Terms and Execution

### Standard Payment Terms

**Net 30:** Payment due 30 days from invoice date (standard default)  
**Net 60:** Extended terms for approved vendors  
**2/10 Net 30:** 2% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise due in 30 days  
**Due on Receipt:** Immediate payment for utilities and statutory payments  

### Payment Methods

**ACH Transfer:** Preferred method for recurring and large payments ($1,000+)  
**Check:** Available for vendors unable to accept electronic payments  
**Wire Transfer:** Reserved for international payments and time-sensitive transactions exceeding $50,000

### Payment Schedule

Payments are processed according to the following schedule:

- ACH batches: Tuesdays and Fridays
- Check runs: Wednesdays
- Wire transfers: As needed with 24-hour advance notice
- International wires: 48-hour advance notice required

## Three-Way Match Verification

Before payment approval, Accounts Payable must verify:

1. Purchase Order matches invoice vendor and amount
2. Receiving report confirms goods/services delivered
3. Invoice details align with PO terms and pricing

Discrepancies exceeding $100 or 5% of invoice value must be researched and resolved before payment.

## Exceptions and Special Circumstances

Emergency payments bypassing standard workflow require:

- Written justification from requesting department
- CFO approval for amounts over $10,000

### Recurring Payments

Pre-approved recurring vendors (rent, utilities, subscriptions) are processed automatically with quarterly reviews to verify:

- Competitive pricing
- Contract compliance
- Accurate billing

### International Vendors

International payments require additional documentation:

- W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E form for tax purposes
- Wire transfer instructions verified directly with vendor

### Vendor Performance Review

Quarterly reviews assess vendor performance on:

## Internal Controls

### Segregation of Duties

No single employee may:

### Audit Trail Requirements

All invoice transactions must maintain:

- Duplicate invoice numbers or amounts
- Round-number invoices without itemization

## Dispute Resolution

### Invoice Discrepancies

Disputed invoices are placed on hold and researched within 5 business days. Resolution requires:

- Communication with vendor to clarify discrepancy
- Department verification of goods/services
- Documented resolution in invoice notes
- Adjusted invoice or credit memo when applicable

### Vendor Escalation Process

**Level 1:** AP Specialist coordinates with vendor (Days 1-5)  
**Level 2:** AP Manager engages department manager (Days 6-10)
